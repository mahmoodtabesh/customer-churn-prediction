Customer acquisition and retention are like the two wings of a bird: if either one is missing, then flight becomes impossible. Similarly, a company needs to both acquire and then retain customers to achieve success in the subscription world.

This task is aimed to explain how to use customer data to help the companyâ€™s growth by applying the predictive model to better understand why and when users withdraw their money from their Robinhood account, i.e., how we can improve customer retention or lower customer churn. One of the powerful tools to enhance Retention Rate (hence the PMF) is Churn Prediction. Using this technique, you can easily find out who is likely to churn in the given period. Here you can find the structure of this project:
